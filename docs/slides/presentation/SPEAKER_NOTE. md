# Objective
- Introduce MvpuExample - A Zero OpenCL Host Code Framework
- How we will create the auto-generation tool on top of the idea


# Storytelling Guide

## Benefits
OpenCL Host Framework
- Zero Host Code
- Instant Comparison
- Platform Switching (Portability)
- Binary Caching
- Easy Extension: JSON Config
Two Phases Architecture
- why we need two-phase architecture
- Auto-generation: Host code offline compiler

## Storyline
Part I: MvpuExample - OpenCL Host Framework
// Introduce the problem we're gonna solve, how we solve it and what's the benefit

- The problem we solve
- introduce features & benefits
- User journey: Introduce simplicity of each step
- How we achieve this: High-Level Architecture
- How we achieve this: Align the opencl host flow
- How we achieve this: Reveal the differences between standard and cl extension; easy switching so don't worries
- How we achieve this: Caching mechanism [it will be helpful for the Part II]
- How we achieve this: Configuration system [we will notice audience that the development keeps going and we will make it simpler in the future]
- Part I Recap

Part II: Auto-Generation Mechanism
// Introduce how we (will) achieve the cross-platoform (standard/cl_ext) support

- Introduce what problem we solve and two-phase architecture
- Compilation phase: What inputs/outputs are, what will be in the binary [TODO#1]
- Execution phase: How many executables [TODO#2]
- Cross-Platform Deliverable: What we will deliver and how the user use it

### TODO
TODO#1: Need to confirm how to explain batch binary, what will be inside (if it's okay to reveal)
TODO#2: Output of compilation phase: GPU-exe(linux), MVPU-exe(linux, android)
